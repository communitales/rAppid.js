# rAppid.js
## Introduction

rAppid.js is a declarative JavaScript web application for rapid web application development. It uses XML to define the structure of applications, modules, components and views and JavaScript for the business logic of the application. The XML (xaml) gets translated to javascript components during runtime which will render itself as HTML5 DOM elements. This enables a rapid development of applications.

## Development

rAppid.js is currently in an early state, defining the component life cycle and other core technics like model bindings, component rendering. Some parts of the interface of rAppid.js are changing until all methods, life-cycles, components are clearly defined and universal re-usable.
